# pixel-class-picker-mockup

A website inspired by Roadwarden in its color and written themes to look like a "Class Selector" from a video game. It's primarly using display: flex, alongside its properties to try to have it look right. Also, media width queries are used again to have it change on different devices. Looking forward to try out display: grid.

Note: the viewport line in the <head> - yeahhh don't forget to add that...
