# pixel-class-picker-mockup

A website inspired by Roadwarden in its color and written themes to look like a "Class Selector" from a video game. It's primarily using display: flex, along with its properties, to achieve the desired look of columned cards. Additionally, media width queries are used again to adjust the content for different devices. Looking forward to trying out display: grid.

Note: the viewport line in the <head> - yeahhh don't forget to add that...

And oh, for me, I'd go either Silkfang or Sorcerer.
